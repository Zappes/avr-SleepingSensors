Licence Warning about the LCD-lib
---------------------------------
I used source code from a tutorial for accessing the LCD. There was no licence on the site, so I have no clue what the licence may be. Better assume that you may not use that code for a commercial project, to be on the safe side. If necessary, try to find out who has the copyright and ask that person. In a friendly way.

The tutorial I used can be found here:

http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR-GCC-Tutorial/LCD-Ansteuerung

The tutorial is absolutely great. It's german, though.
